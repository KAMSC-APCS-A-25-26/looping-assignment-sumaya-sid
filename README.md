# Looping Assignment

Welcome to the **Looping Assignment**! This repository contains Java programming exercises focused on **conditionals and looping** concepts.

---

## Assignment 1: Sum of Even Numbers

### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads an integer value and prints the sum of all even integers between 2 and the input value, inclusive. Print an error message if the input value is less than 2.

### Key Concepts
- **Input validation** with conditional statements
- **For loops** with custom increments
- **Mathematical calculations** and accumulators
- **Error handling** and user feedback

### Examples
```
Enter an integer value: 8
The sum of even numbers between 2 and 8 is 20.
```
*Even numbers: 2, 4, 6, 8 â†’ Sum = 20*


## Assignment 2: Character Per Line

### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads a string from the user and prints each character on a separate line.

### Key Concepts
- **String manipulation** and character access
- **For loops** with string indices
- **Character processing** using charAt()
- **Input/output** formatting

### Examples
```
Enter a word: hello
h
e
l
l
o
```

## Assignment 3: Number Triangle Pattern

### Problem Description
Design and implement an application that reads a positive integer n from the user and prints a number triangle pattern with n rows.

### Key Concepts
- **Nested loops** for pattern generation
- **Console output formatting** with proper spacing
- **Pattern generation** algorithms
- **Loop control** and variable management

### Examples
```
Enter a positive integer: 
1
1 2
1 2 3
1 2 3 4
1 2 3 4 5
```
